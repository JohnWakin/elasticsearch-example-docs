# What is Elastic Search

[Table of Contents](/README.md)

> ### real time data
Data flows into your system all the time. The question is … how quickly can that data become an insight? With Elasticsearch, real-time is the only time.

> ### full text search
Elasticsearch uses Lucene under the covers to provide the most powerful full text search capabilities available in any open source product. Search comes with multi-language support, a powerful query language, support for geolocation, context aware did-you-mean suggestions, autocomplete and search snippets.

> ### restful api
Elasticsearch is API driven. Almost any action can be performed using a simple RESTful API using JSON over HTTP.  An API already exists in the language of your choice.

> ### high availability
Elasticsearch clusters are resilient – they will detect and remove failed nodes, and reorganize themselves to ensure that your data is safe and accessible.
